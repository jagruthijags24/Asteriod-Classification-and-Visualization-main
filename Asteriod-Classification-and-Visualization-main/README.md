# Asteroid Classification Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project applies **machine learning** techniques to classify asteroids based on various features. The **Decision Tree with Cross-Validation (CV)** model achieved **99.62% accuracy**. Model performance was assessed using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Statistical Analysis** – Understanding dataset distributions  
- **Feature Engineering** – Enhancing model inputs  
- **Automated Feature Engineering** – Improving efficiency  
- **Algorithm Optimization** – Fine-tuning ML models  
- **Cross-Validation** – Ensuring model generalization  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training (Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest)  
- Performance evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization  

## Results
